#ReactEurope Lightning talks Call For Papers#

A lightning talk contest will happen on the 2nd of July at 5:30pm in front of the whole audience!

#IMPORTANT: this is only for attendees so you will need a ticket to the conference! You can still get one [here](https://eventlama.com/#/events/reacteurope/tickets).

What's in a lightning? You will have 5 minutes to demo a project of yours or a project you have contributed to, the only requirement is that it must be open source and related to react.js.

**All** lightnings speakers will get awesome prizes as described [here](https://medium.com/@patcito/our-reacteurope-lightning-talks-contest-prizes-61c786e28864).


#How to proceed to submit a lightning#

##Just fork it##

 1. Fork this repository.
 2. Create a directory and name it something such as "my-awesome-lightning" (no spaces).
 3. In that directory, add a proposal.yaml, you can find a [template here](https://github.com/react-europe/cfp-lightnings-2015/blob/master/lightning-sample/proposal.yaml). If there is another speaker, add a Speaker2 key using the same format.
 4. Add a picture of yourself to the dir called speaker1.jpg of size 200x200 (this will be used on the site), if there is another speaker, the file should be named speaker2.jpg and be incremented for each additional speakers.
 5. Commit and create a pull-request to this repo, selected lightnings will be merge into master.
 6. If you want to submit more than one lightning, create a new branch and do a pull request for each branch.
 7. Want to have more chances to get your lightning accepted? Add a link to a youtube video in the past_experience field where you would advertise your talk to attendees so we can re-use the video as promotional material on the conference website (idea from EmberConf :).

You have until Wednesday June 3rd 23:59 UTC+0 to send a proposal
We will announce selected lightnings by Friday June 5th, 2015.

Good luck and thanks for participating!
