  Title: How we are turning React (and Flux) into a dynamic platform to compose the web
  Description: >
    This lightning talk is the (practical) story of how we are turning both React and Flux into a
    dynamic platform to host a variety of apps that interact to create a functional web experience
    with a futuristic twist. We call it [Panels](https://usepanels.com/).

    We are turning React into a rendering platform that links multiple applications through their
    Flux contexts on the fly which allows you to compose the web instead of having it fragmented as
    separate silos - which is how we're currently used to use it.

    Development can be followed at [UXtemple's GitHub](https://github.com/UXtemple).

    We're putting this together with @tomatuxtemple and
    [many experiments](https://usepanels.com/experiments) led us this way :).

  bio: >
    I make things.
    I've been CTO of a couple of startups for the last few years leading every technological
    decisions we faced.
    On the last we focused on actively pushing the web forward by creating a new way of building
    the web which we call Panels.
    I do Open Source and love it.
    All in all, I see technology as a means to an end: to communicate; so going forward I want to
    keep on doing exactly that: I want to lead the way we make the web happen.
