  Title: The Amazing React-Templates!
  Description: >
    React-Templates is a lightweight, yet amazingly powerful templating engine for ReactJS. It compiles into ReactJS
    code. No runtime libraries. No magic. Has an HTML like syntax. Leads to absolute separation of presentation and
    logic and produces runtime HTML that is nearly identical to the template.
    We created it at Wix.com and we use it in our main product - the HTML editor.
    I will demostrate how it improves testability and readability of the code.
    I will also show a couple of great * directives for flow control * (rt-if and rt-repeat) that make the templates very easy to write.
