  Title: JigMagga - isomorphic and static web application
  Description: >
    Nothing is faster but static content. Therefore lot's of static generators appeared
    over the last years. In the process of being the fastest provider of content 
    in our segment without buying insane amount of hard metal
    we have build an application that could be both, single page or statically 
    generated application. Behaviour nor functionalitiy should differ, while logic could both
    run on the client or on the server (e.g. for slow machines). This is the goal of JigMagga, which 
    I like to pitch briefly.
