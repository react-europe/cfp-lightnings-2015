    Title: ReactGym
    Description: >
        In this talk I will demo a workout-tracking application I built using React.
        I will explain my reasoning behind the technology choices I made and 
        provide some insights regarding the pitfalls and challenges encountered when building React applications for multiple platforms.

        I wrote this app to get more familiar with react development as a whole, including extensive unit testing using Jest.
        It is written completely in ES6 and uses Immutable datastructures for all application state.
        The application follows the flux pattern and has all the cool gadgets for productive development like webpack, eslint and react-hot-loader.
        It also has native phonegap builds for Android and iOS, featuring file-based backups.
