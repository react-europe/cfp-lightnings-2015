  Title: React with TinyMCE
  Description: >
    TinyMCE is awesome for its intended purpose. However, it really does not want to be controlled and often does weird things when monitored too closely. In this talk I will cover the things I had to do to make TinyMCE work as a controlled input.

    I write software for Tribune Publishing. For the past two years I have been focused on front-end development. For the past six months I have been leading the front-end redesign of our custom content management system. It was during this process that I discovered React. Now my co-workers are tired of hearing me talk about it, so I need a new outlet.
