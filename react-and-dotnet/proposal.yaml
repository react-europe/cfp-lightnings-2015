  Title: React and .NET
  Description: >
	.NET seems like a hostile environment to JavaScript. For that reason, creating isomorphic JavaScript solutions with React and ASP.NET seems like an impossible task. Thanks to Facebook's ReactJS.NET it is not. This talk will give a high speed overview of ReactJS.NET's features. Be warned, I might convince you to use .NET on the server.
