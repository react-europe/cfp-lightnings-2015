  Title: Brewfactory: Beer Brewing with Node and React
  Description: >
    Have you ever thought about how cool would it be to drink you own beer instead of the commercial ones?
    This story is about us: beer lovers and techies:

    "An IT engineer and a med student walks in to a bar. They get disappointed by the corn infested MegaBrews, so comes the motivation to put up a fight."

    There is nothing hard in brewing your own beer, but some of the processes are really boring and time consuming if you don't automate it.
    Because of this, me and a friend of mine built a semi-automated brewing machine what is powered by Node.js, SparkCore and React.js.
    It runs in the cloud, collect logs, sends notifications and also has an isomorphic React client.

    We call the project http://brewfactory.org/ and already brewed a huge amount of beer with that.
    cheers!
