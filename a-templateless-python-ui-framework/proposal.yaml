  Title: A templateless Python UI framework inspired by React & XHP
  Description: >
    Python at a cutting-edge front end conference?? *ducks for cover*. A key revelation of 
    React is that the server-side folk have it easy: regenerating an entire page from scratch 
    is far simpler than micromanaging state strewn across DOM elements. For web applications 
    that don’t require a high degree of interactivity (not all do), there’s still a big 
    advantage to server-side UI:
        - Direct access to the data layer. No need to wrangle REST, decide on a Flux framework, 
          or hold out for a certain silver-bullet data fetching technology.
        - By default you get an accessible and SEO friendly website with a fully compliant 
          Roy Fielding HATEOAS™ API.
        - You’re free to write it in JS …but you don’t have to!

    The other revelation is ~~the virtual dom~~ that templates suck and composability rules. 
    I bring you Compony (https://github.com/mbylstra/compony), a Pythonic UI framework with a 
    similar set of features for stateless (“dumb”) components to React such as props, children, 
    and contexts (we call them them “xrays”). Compony also introduces a couple of novel 
    features: “regions” and “swaps”, but I’ve run out of space to tell you what they are, so 
    you’ll have to upvote this submission to find out!
