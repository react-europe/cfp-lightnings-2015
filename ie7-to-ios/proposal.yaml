  Title: IE7 to iOS with Marty.js
  Description: >
    A talk about how you can use Marty.js to support a wide variety of browsers and platforms.
    I will discuss how you can write modern JS while still support legacy browsers (e.g. IE < 9) by utilising isomorphism.
    Also I will show how you can re-use the same code base to build react native applications.
