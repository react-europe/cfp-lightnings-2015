  Title: Lessons Learned at AnyRoad
  Description: >
    Lessons learned at AnyRoad from having:
    - A client-side rendered react SPA with a in-house take on flux in production for 8 months
    - A server-side rendered react app with a more cannonical take on flux in production for 4 months

    I want to cover some of the major decisions we've made, why they were good or bad and what we learned from them.
    Hopefully you guys will find more flaws and help us do a better job.
