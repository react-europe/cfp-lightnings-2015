  bio: >
    I've been a front-end engineer for the past 4 years, and I'm loving every minute of it.
    Before I became an engineer I was a product manager for several years, until I got tired of asking other people to do stuff :)
    Currently a Team leader at Wix.com. In the last year, I am working on re-writing our main product with ReactJS - the HTML website editor.
