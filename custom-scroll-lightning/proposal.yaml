  Title: Custom scrollbar with ReactJS
  Description: >
    Designing the scrollbar is an important part of an application UI, but it isn't easy to achieve.
    The native scrollbar usually doesn't fit the UI language of the application, and every combination
    of browser + OS can produce a differet look for the scrollbar.
    The smallest library I found that allows custom scrollbar was more than 1000 lines of codes, and had lots of bugs.
    So I wrote react-custom-scroll. Easy to use, less than 200 lines of code, and more importantly - cross browser including IE 9+.
    The scroll behavior is native (animation, ratio, smooth), the design is the only part which is custom.
    I will show a demo and explain in short who to use the component, and how it works.
    This is the scroll in our new HTML editor at Wix.com.
