  Title: Store relationships made easy
  Description: >
    Getting tired of manually handling store relationships in flux? In this talk i will go through how i made store 
    relationships painless in Capacitor.js based on @gaearons classification of stores. This talk will feature
    usage examples, immutable.js data structures and how to cache the right things properly to ensure strict comparability.
    I will end the talk by reflecting on the pros and cons of being able to easily split up stores in no time.
